Python Review Exercise 2 1hr35mins until 3:00 Ireland time
========================
remember - look online, ask me, ask each other.... work in teams

For this project, use modules and imports to separate your code structures

In a new module, write a class called 'Weather'
In the __init__ method receive two properties: 'city' and 'temperature'
Write getter nd setter methods for these two properties
If time validate that 'city' is a non-empty string
and 'temeprature' is an int or a float (raise TypeErrors if not)
Write a __str__ method to nicely print these details
Exercise the code to create an instance of the weather

Next, in another module import your Weather class
You will also need something like this at the top of this module:
  from threading import Thread
  import requests

Write a 'WeatherGetter' class that inherits from Thread
In the __init__ method provide a 'city' parameter

Declare a 'run' method for your class
In the 'run' method, populate a response object by calling 'requests.get' for this end-point:
  http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=athlone&units=metric&APPID=957d663a2296945e39a56609740a2548
  (replace 'athlone' with the city parameter)
  (You may choose to sign up for a free API key, or use my API key, good for 60 requests/min)
Populate a 'data' object from the response as JSON, then set self.temperature to the returned temperature, e.g.
  data = response.json()	   # convert the returned reponse to JSON
  self.temperature = data['main']['temp']  # access the temperature property from the JSON

Declare a list of cities, e.g. 
  CITIES = ['Athlone', 'Dublin', 'Galway', 'Belfast', 'Genoa', 'Cork', 'Budapest', 'Kista']
Iterate over these cities, starting a new thread for your 'WeatherGetter' for each city
(if we hit the throughput limit I have alternative API keys...)

Print out the temperature for each of the cities

Optionaly include code to time how long it takes to retrieve all the weather reports
Remember to code against the main types of error that might occur here

Optional
--------
Also show other weather data, such as wind speed and direction, the weather description etc.
Show the temperature as Celcius (the default), Kelvin (-273) and Fahrenheit (°F=°C*1.8+32.0)

Try retrieving a lot of cities (but be careful of the 60-a-minute limit):
Here is a list of many of the cities of Ireland:
["Dublin","Cork","Limerick","Galway","Waterford","Drogheda","Kilkenny","Wexford","Sligo","Clonmel","Dundalk","Bray","Ennis","Tralee","Carlow","Naas","Athlone","Letterkenny","Tullamore","Killarney","Arklow","Cobh","Castlebar","Midleton","Mallow","Ballina","Enniscorthy","Wicklow","Cavan","Athenry","Longford","Dungarvan","Nenagh","Trim","Thurles","Youghal","Monaghan","Buncrana","Ballinasloe","Fermoy","Westport","Carrick-on-Suir","Birr","Tipperary","Carrickmacross","Kinsale","Listowel","Clonakilty","Cashel","Macroom","Castleblayney","Kilrush","Skibbereen","Bundoran","Templemore","Clones","Newbridge","Mullingar","Balbriggan","Greystones","Leixlip","Tramore","Shannon","Gorey","Tuam","Edenderry","Bandon","Loughrea","Ardee","Mountmellick","Bantry","Boyle","Ballyshannon","Cootehill","Ballybay","Belturbet","Lismore","Kilkee","Granard"]

Try This
--------
Use the 'lon' and 'lat' values to store retrieved weather data as a text file including 'lon' and 'lat'
